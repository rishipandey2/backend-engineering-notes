# Linux : Day 3 Notes 🐧

## 1. Permissions & Ownership
Managing who can see or change files is a core part of Linux security.

* **`chmod` (Change Mode):** Used to change file permissions (Read `r`, Write `w`, Execute `x`).
    * *Example:* `chmod +x script.sh` makes a file executable.
* **`chown` (Change Owner):** Used to change the user or group ownership of a file.
* **Root User:** The "Superuser" (UID 0) who has full control over the system. Often accessed via `sudo`.



---

## 2. Scripts & Execution
* **`.sh` files:** The standard extension for Shell scripts.
* **Shebang (`#!`):** The first line in a script that tells the system which interpreter to use. 
    * *Example:* `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
* **Compiled vs. Interpreted:**
    * **Compiled:** Code is translated into machine code *before* running (e.g., C++). Fast execution.
    * **Interpreted:** Code is read and executed line-by-line (e.g., Bash, Python). Easier to debug.

---

## 3. The Environment & Shell
* **Shell Configuration:** Files like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` that load your settings every time you open a terminal.
* **Environment Variables:** Key-value pairs that influence how the system behaves (e.g., `USER`, `HOME`).
* **`PATH`:** Perhaps the most important variable. It contains a list of directories where the shell looks for executable programs.

---

## 4. Documentation & Streams
* **`man` (Manual):** The "Bible" of the terminal. Use `man <command>` to see the full documentation.
* **Arguments:**
    * **Flags/Options:** Usually start with `-` or `--` (e.g., `ls -l`).
    * **Positional Arguments:** The "targets" of the command (e.g., the filename in `cat file.txt`).
* **I/O Streams:**
    * **Standard In (stdin):** Data sent *to* a program.
    * **Standard Out (stdout):** Normal output from a program.
    * **Standard Error (stderr):** Error messages generated by a program.
* **Exit Codes:** A number returned by a program when it finishes. `0` usually means success; anything else indicates an error.

---

## 5. Package Managers
Software for Linux is managed through repositories.
* Examples: `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu), `brew` (macOS), or language-specific ones like `gem` (Ruby).

## 6. Neovim Basics (The "Escape" Guide) 🧩
Neovim is a modal editor. You aren't always "typing" text; sometimes you are "navigating."

| Action | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Open a file** | `nvim <filepath>` |
| **Normal Mode** | Default mode for moving around. Press `Esc` to return here. |
| **Insert Mode** | Press `i` to start typing text. |
| **Save changes** | `:w` (followed by Enter) |
| **Quit Neovim** | `:q` (followed by Enter) |
| **Save & Quit** | `:wq` (followed by Enter) |

> **Note:** To "Redact" the password in the assignment, I used `i` to enter Insert Mode, deleted the sensitive info, typed `REDACTED`, hit `Esc`, and saved with `:w`.
